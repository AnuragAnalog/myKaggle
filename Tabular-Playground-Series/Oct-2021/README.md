# September Challenge

## Data Description

For this competition, you will be predicting a binary target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The columns are a mix of scaled continuous features and binary features.

The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on real-world molecular response data.

### Files


* train.csv - the training data with the target column
* test.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the target for each row in this file (the probability of the binary target)
* sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

**Kaggle Download API Command**

`kaggle competitions download -c tabular-playground-series-oct-2021`

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on [area under the ROC curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) between the predicted probability and the observed target.

### Submission File
For each `id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the `target` variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,target
100000,0.5
100001,0.9
100002,0.1
etc.
```

## Timeline

* Start Date - October 1, 2021
* Entry deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline
* Team Merger deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline
* Final submission deadline - October 31, 2021

All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.
