# December Challenge

## Data Description

For this competition, you will be predicting a categorical target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a the data from the [Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/overview). This dataset is (a) much larger, and (b) may or may not have the same relationship to the target as the original data.

Please refer to this [data page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/data) for a detailed explanation of the features.

### Files

* train.csv - the training data with the target `Cover_Type` column
* test.csv - the test set; you will be predicting the `Cover_Type` for each row in this file (the target integer class)
* sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

4000001,3
etc.
